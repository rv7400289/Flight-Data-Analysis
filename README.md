# Flight-Data-Analysis
Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I've just wrapped up a cool practice project where I analyzed flight data using Python and SQL. 

Below Problem which we have to solve after analying the flight database.

Business Problem :
Our airline has been delivering top-notch air travel experiences to our customers, focusing on safety and comfort. However, we're grappling with economic challenges like stricter regulations, increased taxes, higher interest rates, and rising fuel costs. These factors, along with elevated labor expenses due to a competitive job market, are impacting our profitability.

To overcome these hurdles, we're proactively exploring solutions. As part of this effort, we're diving into our data to pinpoint opportunities that can enhance our occupancy rates. Our goal is to maximize the profit earned per seat, ensuring the continued success and sustainability of our services.
